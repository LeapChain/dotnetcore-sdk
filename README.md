# TheNewBoston .NET Core SDK

This is a .NET Core SDK for **thenewboston**, which will be available cross-platoform. The library itself will solely contain the domain and data layers of **thenewboston**. The presentation layer will be the responsibility of the host application.

## How to get started

It's recommended to first go through https://www.thenewboston.com/guide/introduction.
Once you understood the concept of thenewboston then check out https://github.com/thenewboston-developers/Account-Manager and run the application. Create an account and play around a bit. Everything that happens behind the UI is what this SDK will cover.
